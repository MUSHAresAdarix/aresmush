# About Pathfinder 1E

AdarixMUSH uses the open-source Pathfinder 1E RPG system, detailed at: 

https://www.aonprd.com/
https://www.d20pfsrd.com/

More details on many skills, feats, items, spells, and more can be found at these two sites. Note that not all elements described in these sites are implemented on AdarixMUSH -- an element described in these sites but not found on AdarixMUSH means that that element is not approved for play on the game. Please refer to [House Rules] to determine whether the desired element has been explicitly denied, or simply not yet considered.
