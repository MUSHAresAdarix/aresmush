# Hooks
This command lets you record hooks -- details about your character's personality and background that can be used by a plotmaster in nefariously fun ways. Hooks are visible to yourself, to staff, and to plotmasters, and may be changed or added to at any time. 

`hooks` - Show your own hooks.
`hooks/set <new hook>` - Sets your hooks. This command overwrites the previous set. 

`hooks <name>` - (For plotmasters and staff only) View <name>'s hooks.
